So welcome group 7, this is the beginning of our Store Operation Management System, just get used to some common git commands first 
like:-
git status
git add .
git remove
git commit -m "insert commit description"
git push
git pull 

I can assure you the commands above is about the command you're going to use 99% of the time so try to learn how each of the commands work
